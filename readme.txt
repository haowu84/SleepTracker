No.


--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
Yes, the users that log their full nightâ€™s sleep in the morning.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
I designed app for for both IOS and Android.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
They can log the start time and end time with date-time spinners. The date-time spinner is good for recording date/time, and it is less error-prone than a text input. 


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
They can log sleepiness with a slider. The slider is good for recording numeric value, and it is easier to use than a checkbox or a dropdown. 


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
They can view the data by toggling the overnight sleep switch and sleepiness switch. It allows to view the sleep data together or separately.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
I choose to do both.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
I used the sharing plugin. It allows the users to send their sleep data or sleepiness data to their friends and family. 


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
It is backed up to ionic storage. 


14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
The app uses a tab bar to separate the main functions of the app into several categories and support navigation. The appropriate UI components are used to prevent errors from use input.
